"""Deterministically diff a pre-change scrape against a post-change scrape.

Pre-change data: latest bulk data JSON from https://open.pluralpolicy.com/data/,
auto-fetched by default (jurisdiction is auto-detected from --post; requires
OPENSTATES_EMAIL / OPENSTATES_PASSWORD env vars for login). Pass --pre to override
with a local directory/zip or an explicit URL instead.
Post-change data: the download attached to a PR (fork release asset, uploaded zip,
or a raw directory) in the same schema.

The two sides are not always the same shape: a published archive is the imported
product of earlier scrapes, so it renames some fields, carries others the scraper
never writes, and folds each bill's vote events into the bill itself. Those votes
are lifted back out into vote_event records, aliased fields are renamed to the
scraper's spelling, and fields genuinely present on only one side are reported as
schema differences instead of changes -- but only when the two sides were produced
differently, so a scrape-to-scrape comparison still diffs every field.

Records are matched by (legislative_session, identifier) so vote_events are matched
by (legislative_session, bill_identifier, identifier) since they lack a bill identifier
field directly usable across runs -- see RECORD_KEY_FIELDS. Some jurisdictions (e.g. AZ)
never populate vote_events.identifier; when it's blank, vote_events fall back to
(legislative_session, bill_identifier, start_date, motion_text) instead -- see record_key.

Usage:
    python scripts/compare_scrapes.py --post PATH_OR_URL
    python scripts/compare_scrapes.py --pre PATH_OR_URL --post PATH_OR_URL

PATH may be a directory of .json files, or a .zip containing them; either shape may
hold one record per file (scraper output) or a single JSON array of records (the
published bulk archives). If it looks like an http(s) URL it is downloaded first.
Records are streamed and read one at a time, so a full jurisdiction fits in a CI
runner's memory.
